<h1>BMW M4</h1> 
<h1><i><u><b> The BMW M4 is a version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division,  
BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible 
variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades over 
the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight 
reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car.</h1></i></u></b>
